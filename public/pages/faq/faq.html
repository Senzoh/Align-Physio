        You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows for easy movement and access to the area being treated. If you're attending for a lower body issue, 
        wearing shorts or loose-fitting pants that can be rolled up is ideal. For upper body concerns, a sleeveless top or a loose T-shirt works best. If your session 
        involves movement assessments, athletic wear and trainers are recommended. Avoid jeans, tight clothing, or restrictive footwear, as they may limit movement and 
        make assessment or treatment more difficult.

    <div data-target="faq" class="hidden pt-5 pb-5">
      <p>
        Physiotherapy isn’t just about temporary relief — it’s focused on correcting the root cause of pain and dysfunction. With consistent treatment and guidance, most clients experience long-term improvement, not just symptom masking.

      Recovery takes time and consistency. While some feel better after one session, others need a few to see lasting change. We monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed — you’re never left guessing.
